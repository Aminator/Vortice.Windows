**Vortice.Windows** is a collection of Win32 and UWP libraries with bindings support for [DXGI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-dxgi), [WIC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wic/-wic-lh), [DirectWrite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/directwrite/direct-write-portal), [Direct2D](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct2d/direct2d-portal), [Direct3D11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d11/atoc-dx-graphics-direct3d-11) and [Direct3D12](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directx-12-programming-guide).

This project was born as [SharpDX](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX) was recently inactive and the aim is to have .net standard 2.0 API and usage
of modern stuff like Unsafe and SharpGen.Runtime.
